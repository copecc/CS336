# CS336 Spring 2024 Assignment 4: Data

For a full description of the assignment, see the assignment handout at
[cs336_spring2024_assignment4_data.pdf](./cs336_spring2025_assignment4_data.pdf)

If you see any issues with the assignment handout or code, please feel free to
raise a GitHub issue or open a pull request with a fix.

## Setup

This directory is organized as follows:

- [`./cs336-basics`](./cs336-basics): directory containing a module
  `cs336_basics` and its associated `pyproject.toml`. This module contains the staff 
  implementation of the language model from assignment 1. If you want to use your own 
  implementation, you can replace this directory with your own implementation.
- [`./cs336_data`](./cs336_data): This folder is basically empty! This is the
  module where you will implement your optimized Transformer language model. 
  Feel free to take whatever code you need from assignment 1 (in `cs336-basics`) and copy it 
  over as a starting point. In addition, you will implement distributed training and
  optimization in this module.

Visually, it should look something like:

``` sh
.
├── cs336_basics  # A python module named cs336_basics
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── ... other files in the cs336_basics module, taken from assignment 1 ...
├── cs336_data  # TODO(you): code that you'll write for assignment 2 
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── ... TODO(you): any other files or folders you need for assignment 2 ...
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
└── ... TODO(you): other files or folders you need for assignment 2 ...
```

If you would like to use your own implementation of assignment 1, replace the `cs336-basics`
directory with your own implementation, or edit the outer `pyproject.toml` file to point to your
own implementation. As in previous assignments, we use `uv` to manage dependencies.

## Submitting

To submit, run `./test_and_make_submission.sh` . This script will install your
code's dependencies, run tests, and create a gzipped tarball with the output. We
should be able to unzip your submitted tarball and run
`./test_and_make_submission.sh` to verify your test results.
